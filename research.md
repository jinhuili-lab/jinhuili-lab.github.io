In my previous work， I joined in many projects, including drug design, multi-omics, AI model building, software and database development.

1. SApredict, We build the model for predict the SA according to the metagenomics.

2. MicrobioSee. The development of Multi-omics visualization toolkit.
	- In this work, we developed MicrobioSee, a real-time interactive visualization tool based on web technologies, which could visualize microbial multi-omics data. 
	- It includes 17 modules surrounding the major omics data of microorganisms such as the transcriptome, metagenome, and proteome. 
	- Most of the tools in MicrobioSee were built with shiny services to achieve real-time interactive plotting.

3. SMDB. Sulfur metabolism in subtropical marine mangrove sediments fundamentally differs from other habitats as revealed by SMDB
	- we introduce SMDB (https://smdb.gxu.edu.cn/)—a manually curated database of sulfur genes based on an in-depth review of the scientific literature and orthology database.
	- The SMDB contained a total of 175 genes and covered 11 sulfur metabolism processes with 395,737 representative sequences affiliated with 110 phyla and 2340 genera of bacteria/archaea.
	- SMDB will assist researchers to analyze genes of sulfur cycle from the metagenomic efficiently.	

### Fulture

- Now I want to explore the relationship between the repeats area in multiple genomics and disease, such as AD.
