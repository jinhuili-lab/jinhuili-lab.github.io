In my previous workï¼Œ I focusd on many projects, including metagenomics assembly, drug design, multi-omics, AI model building, software and database development.

1. SApredict. We build the Machine learning model to predict the SA based on the metagenomics. Under review.

2. MicrobioSee. The development of Multi-omics visualization toolkit.
	- Avalable at: [https://microbiosee.gxu.edu.cn/](https://microbiosee.gxu.edu.cn/)
	- In this work, we developed MicrobioSee, a real-time interactive visualization tool based on web technologies, which could visualize microbial multi-omics data. 
	- It includes 17 modules surrounding the major omics data of microorganisms such as the transcriptome, metagenome, and proteome. 
	- Most of the tools in MicrobioSee were built with shiny services to achieve real-time interactive plotting.

3. SMDB. Sulfur metabolism in subtropical marine mangrove sediments fundamentally differs from other habitats as revealed by SMDB.
	- Avalable at: 
		[https://smdb.gxu.edu.cn/](https://smdb.gxu.edu.cn/)
	- we introduce [SMDB](https://smdb.gxu.edu.cn/) a manually curated database of sulfur genes based on an in-depth review of the scientific literature and orthology database.
	- The SMDB contained a total of 175 genes and covered 11 sulfur metabolism processes with 395,737 representative sequences affiliated with 110 phyla and 2340 genera of bacteria/archaea.
	- SMDB will assist researchers to analyze genes of sulfur cycle from the metagenomic efficiently.

### Fulture
Computational biology research is very exciting. 
- Now I focus on  explore the relationship between the repeats area in multiple genomics and disease, such as AD. 
	* More and more species genomics has been sequenced, but few are explored clearly. Using new methods to explore pathogenicity of the repeats.
	* At the same time, I want to develop some tools to detect the repeats in multiple species genomics. Machine learning and Deep learning are very useful algorithms for that. GPU cuda technique also can promote my research.
- Also, I want to continue my metagenome research. 
	* Developing a software to assembly the metagenomics with low momery is neccessary now.
	* Based on the FMT technique(Fecal microbiota transplantation), It is very meaningful to improve the well-being of cancer or sub-healthy people.
