### My story

To be honest, you can visit my [resume](https://jinhuili-lab.github.io/resume/) to know me.
I got my bachelar degree and master degree in China. After working for sequencer R&D center of BGI group for one year, I found that this hinders my growth. So I seeked for a PhD position, and finally joined the Zhang Lab. in SLU.
